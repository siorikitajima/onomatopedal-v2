            <h2>OnomatoPedal Studio Guide</h2>
        </div>
        <p><b>OnomatoPedal Studio</b> is a browser based application that allows a musical artist to build the audio portion of an interactive audio-visual OnomatoPedal by uploading short audio 'samples' that will trigger when keys on the keyboard are pressed along with three looping bakcground 'stems'. An <b>OnomatoPedal</b> is an EQD inspired interactive experience that end users can play with by triggering sounds and visuals at OnomatoPedal.com.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>  On <a href="/stems">'Stems' page</a>, upload up to three different stems (mp3s). These are audio tracks that the user can loop in the background as they trigger sounds. </li>
            <li> There are three placeholder stems set when you first login. Delete first then upload your audio files.</li>
            <li> 'Play All Stems' button on the bottom of the screen to test your stems.</li>
            <li> If the stems are all the same length, they will loop in sync with each other which is good for tight rhythm based music but you can also upload stems of varying lengths which would be good for ambient and more sound designerly type tracks.</li>
            <li> One stem file must be smaller than <b>5MG</b> and in <b>MP3</b> format.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>    
            <li>  On <a href="/samples">'Samples' page</a>, upload and edit short samples (mp3s) that the end user will trigger by playing keys on their keyboard. </li>
            <li> There are three placeholder samples set when you first login for you to test.</li>
            <li> When uploading new sample from 'Add New' button, set the 'Sample Pitch' of each sample. This app generates audio based on it. (i.e. If the Sample pitch is 'C4' and the Key pitch is 'E4', the result audio is two pitches higher than the original audio file.)</li>
            <li> For your convenience, we recommend to name the sample using the Sample pitch (i.e. 'C4-piano', 'G#5tone', etc) of the sound.</li>
            <li> If you delete a sample, keys using the sample will be disabled.</li>
            <li> One sample file must be smaller than <b>500KB</b> and in <b>MP3</b> format.</li>
